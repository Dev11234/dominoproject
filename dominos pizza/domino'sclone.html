A call, a few clicks on our website or a few touches on the mobile screen is all you have to do to have that tempting, light-on-the-pocket pizza at your doorstep.
                    
                    There is something for everyone here. The vegetarians, non-vegetarians, the sides' lovers and also the ones who love to have something sweet by the time they reach the last bite of the last slice of pizza slice.</DD>

                 Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom to choose your toppings - from paneer,<br><br><br> crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden 
                 corn, black olives, fresh tomato, red paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non
                 -veg toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri chicken, grilled chicken rasher, chicken 
                 sausage or chicken tikka- the options are almost endless, anything and everything you can think of that
                  too on top of the crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin crust, cheese burst crust, classic 
                  hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan pizza. Because just like a pizza, Domino's understands you.

                   <br> Domino's takes only half an hour for its pizza delivery service. Don't believe us? Time 
                    <br>it if you please. With 1250+ stores present all over India, you can have a Domino's pizza even 
                    <br>while traveling on a train. Yes, you are reading it right, you can enjoy pizza on train too.
                    <br><br><br>
                    So stop googling for the “pizza shops near me” and order from your nearest pizza outlet to have a hot box of pizza on your table in the next 30 minutes, or berth at the next halting station.</p>
